# ShegerBusSystem
a bus system written in c++ using pure OOP and Data Structure concept, Singly Linked List.. 


To run the program:
-> if you are a developer, use the "Sheger" project file which you will find as a 2KB size.
-> if you are not a developer or just don't want to run through the code, try looking for the .exe file.
        *Its location is Sheger\bin\Debug\Sheger.exe

/*IF THE CODE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED CHECK THE BELOW

-A problem you might run into is shown in a .png picture that shows a temporary problem, in which some charachters seems to be taken away!
-The picture name is ProblemDSA.png, and you will find it on the surface.
