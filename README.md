# ShegerBusSystem

An Ethiopian, locally built Bus System, written in C++ using pure OOP and Data Structure concept, Singly Linked List.


To run the program:

       -> if you are a developer, use the "Sheger" project file which you will find as a 2KB size. Its name is Sheger.cbp
       -> if you are not a developer or just don't want to run through the code, try looking for the .exe file. Run the file as an adminstrator just in case!
       
               *Its location is Sheger\bin\Debug\Sheger.exe

If you are willing to edit our code, for example to add other features such as Sorting and others, pull a request or directly edit both the "Sheger.cpp" and "Sheger.h" to add up. Additionally, you may change the "monitor.h" and "monitor.cpp" for any further updation.

You will find the files in the "src" and "include" folders respectevly.
